Besides, the 75% of jobs offer annual salary above $75,000 which is beyond U.S. median annual income $59,540 in 2023 Q4.\n2. Salary Stats of Top 5 Demanded Skills\nThe median salary (represented by the horizontal line inside each box) varies across top demanded skills, and Python appears to have the highest median salary, followed by Tableau and R. As a junior data analyst job seeker, being proficient in Python and Tableau could enhance your job prospects and potentially lead to better salary opportunities. 3. Salary Stats of Top 5 Paying Skills\nSkills relevant to big data, distributed data management and machine learning are required for high-paying jobs. Kafka and PyTorch have higher Q3 and mean salary among top 5 paying skills despite their median value not being the highest. Job seekers with proficiency in these skills may have access to a subset of high-paying jobs that offer competitive salaries above the median and mean of the entire job listings. 4. Optimal Skills Analysis\nFrom previous highlights, we analyzed top 5 demanded and top 5 paying skills and their salary stats. Now, we look into optimal skills (top 25 paying skills that have over 10 job listings) while applying the concept of BCG Matrix to analyze top skills and make strategy to develop our skillset.\nAmong top 25 paying skills that have over 10 job listings:\nHigh Demand, High Salary (Star):\nAirflow, Scala, Linux, Confluence, PySpark\nHigh Demand, Low Salary (Cash cow):\nSnowflake, Spark, Hadoop, Databricks, pandas, GCP, Git\nLow Demand, Low Salary (Pet):\nMongoDB, Splunk, Shell, Unix, phoenix, PHP\nLow Demand, High Salary (Question mark):\nKafka, PyTorch, Perl, TensorFlow, Cassandra, Atlassian\nDespite skills like Kafka, PyTorch, Perl, TensorFlow and Cassandra tend to be high-paying, their demands on market are not as many as skills in Star and Cash cow quadrants.\nRather than finding either top demanded skills or top paying skills, we could develop our skillset strategy to pave the career in data analysis field.\nAs a junior Data Analyst, I want to prioritize which optimal skills to learn or enhance based on not only my interest but also the degree of financial stability and prospect. First, I would enhance my skills on Hadoop, pandas to get financial stability. And then, I would invest myself to extend skillset on Spark, PySpark, Snowflake and Airflow for obtaining higher paying and sought-after jobs.\n5.

We utilized Hadoop for data cleaning and Hive for analyzing Yelp reviews of successful US restaurants. By integrating this with US demographic data, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that contribute to a restaurant\u0026rsquo;s success.\nTools I Used # Java Hadoop Hive Google Cloud console Tableau Visual Studio Analysis # Analysis Diagram Data Analysis\nAfter data cleaning and profiling, we joined the datasets and analyzed the joined table by using Hive on HDFS. Firstly, we joined the Business, Review and User datasets by using business_id and user_id as foreign keys, then performed analysis to provide insights into the success patterns of popular restaurants in the US and user behavior on Yelp.\nIn the analysis of Businesses, we select users with an average star rating higher than 3 as ‚Äògood_users‚Äô, and use their ratings to evaluate a business to ensure the quality of reviews. We first select the top 10 restaurants with highest average ranking and review count by good users, and then select top 10 Businesses with Highest Review Variability by \u0026lsquo;Good\u0026rsquo; Users to show the businesses of different categories that have highly polarized reviews; We also selected top 10 businesses with the first category with highest review count and highest average rating to see the most popular and best rating businesses in different business types.\nIn the analysis of user behavior, we have computed user average review count, average user rating, and Number of Yelp users added per year from the joined table.\nData Visualization\nAfter analyzing data on Hadoop, we visualized the result by using Tableau to transform the results into compelling and engaging visualizations.\na. Top 10 restaurants by good users b. Top 10 restaurants by good users with business categories and state information c. Geographical distribution of reviews in the U.S. d. Number of Yelp users added per year Insights\nIn the analysis of popular restaurants on Yelp, we can see that the most popular restaurants with the highest rating by good users are mostly in state CA, NV, MO, TN, PA and AZ, and different states show their preference on different kinds of cuisine, for example, we observe that in CA, popular restaurants are bars or catering while in PA, popular restaurants are Mediterranean food, and in FL, popular restaurants are foods like salad, bakery and poke. These preferences could have comprehensive analysis with population, lifestyle and weather dataset with corresponding states.\nIn the analysis of Businesses, we can see that the most popular businesses with the highest reviews count and the best businesses with highest average rating are highly identical. Which means that popularity and service quality are highly positively correlated, so a company can attract more customers by improving the quality of its food and service.\nBy analyzing the number of reviews and average ratings for all types of business, we found that the top three most popular types of business are Local Services, Food Trucks and Laundry Services, So if there are users who want to start a business, they can consider choosing these areas and will have a greater chance of success.\nWe also analyzed the variance of business rating. This analysis allowed us to know which companies\u0026rsquo; scores are highly polarized, and these companies can look deeper into the causes of this phenomenon and make improvements.\nIn the analysis of user behavior, we found that Yelp\u0026rsquo;s highest number of new users was from 2011 to 2015, after which it showed a year-on-year decline, suggesting that Yelp could address this decline in new users by making improvements, such as developing new features or new incentives to attract more users.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/hadoop/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eüìä rbda-hadoop-hive-yelp \n    \u003cdiv id=\"-rbda-hadoop-hive-yelp\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#-rbda-hadoop-hive-yelp\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the final project for üéì NYU Realtime and Big Data Analytics course.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Yelp's Reviews Analysis","type":"projects"},{"content":" üìä divvy-riders-usage-analysis # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/tableau-1/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eüìä divvy-riders-usage-analysis \n    \u003cdiv id=\"-divvy-riders-usage-analysis\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#-divvy-riders-usage-analysis\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1730228973640' style='position: relative'\u003e\u003cnoscript\u003e\u003ca href='#'\u003e\u003cimg alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:\u0026#47;\u0026#47;public.tableau.com\u0026#47;static\u0026#47;images\u0026#47;YE\u0026#47;YEH_HSIN_DivvyRidersUsageAnalysis2021SEP\u0026#47;Dashboard1\u0026#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/noscript\u003e\u003cobject class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'\u003e\u003cparam name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /\u003e \u003cparam name='embed_code_version' value='3' /\u003e \u003cparam name='site_root' value='' /\u003e\u003cparam name='name' value='YEH_HSIN_DivvyRidersUsageAnalysis2021SEP\u0026#47;Dashboard1' /\u003e\u003cparam name='tabs' value='no' /\u003e\u003cparam name='toolbar' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='static_image' value='https:\u0026#47;\u0026#47;public.tableau.com\u0026#47;static\u0026#47;images\u0026#47;YE\u0026#47;YEH_HSIN_DivvyRidersUsageAnalysis2021SEP\u0026#47;Dashboard1\u0026#47;1.png' /\u003e \u003cparam name='animate_transition' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='display_static_image' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='display_spinner' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='display_overlay' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='display_count' value='yes' /\u003e\u003cparam name='language' value='en-US' /\u003e\u003c/object\u003e\u003c/div\u003e                \u003cscript type='text/javascript'\u003e                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1730228973640');
